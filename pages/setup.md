## IMPORTANT NOTE

Some of the following passages refer to your 'Terminal', to access it, follow the directions for your operating system...

**(Windows)**

Go to your 'Start Menu', then the' Windows PowerShell' folder, and click Windows PowerShell.

*FOR ADMIN PRIVILEGES:* If you need admin privileges, instead of left-clicking, **RIGHT-CLICK** the 'Windows PowerShell' application and Choose 'Launch as Administrator' (or something like that). Enter your password when prompted.

**(OSX)**

Go to your Applications folder, then the Utilities folder. Then, click the 'Terminal' application.

*FOR ADMIN PRIVILEGES:* <br> If you need admin privileges, start your command with 'sudo'. For example, `fakecommand --fake-option "some/fake/path"` would become `sudo fakecommand --fake-option "some/fake/path"`. You will be asked to enter your password, and then the command will run.
